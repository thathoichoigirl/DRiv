## Features âœ¨
Crypto tokens can solve a variety of problems, depending on the specific use case and the design of the token. In general, crypto tokens are digital assets that are created and managed using blockchain technology, which enables them to be easily transferred, traded, and verified without the need for intermediaries like banks or other financial institutions.<br><br>

Here are some common problems that RIVity(RIV) tokens can solve:<br><br>

Facilitating decentralized transactions: RIV tokens can enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, which can reduce transaction costs, increase speed, and provide greater privacy and security.<br><br>

Creating digital scarcity: By using blockchain technology to create a limited supply of tokens, issuers can create digital scarcity, which can increase the value and desirability of the tokens.<br><br>

Providing incentives for network participation: RIV tokens are designed to incentivize users to participate in a network by offering rewards or other benefits for contributing computing power, storage, or other resources. <br><br>

Enabling programmable money: RIV tokens can be designed to have programmable functionality, which means that they can be used to automate complex financial transactions and execute smart contracts.<br><br>

Providing fundraising mechanisms: RIV tokens are used as a means of raising capital for startups or other projects, either through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or other fundraising mechanisms.<br><br>

Overall, RIV tokens provide a powerful new tool for creating decentralized digital assets and networks that can solve a variety of problems in a wide range of industries and use cases.<br><br>

# Check your Balance

1. Find out your principal id:

```
dfx identity get-principal
```

2. Save it somewhere.

e.g. My principal id is: muab5-co4k5-f7bud-ejhga-gadbv-ms4xr-n2gkb-pyhov-nga2w-uhhm7-mae


3. Format and store it in a command line variable:
```
OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx identity get-principal )\""
```

4. Check that step 3 worked by printing it out:
```
echo $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

5. Check the owner's balance:
```
dfx canister call token balanceOf "( $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY )"
```

# Charge the Canister


1. Check canister ID:
```
dfx canister id token
```

2. Save canister ID into a command line variable:
```
CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister id token )\""
```

3. Check canister ID has been successfully saved:
```
echo $CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

4. Transfer half a billion tokens to the canister Principal ID:
```
dfx canister call token transfer "($CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY, 500_000_000)"
```

# Deploy the Project to the Live IC Network

1. Create and deploy canisters:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

2. Check the live canister ID:
```
dfx canister --network ic id token
```

3. Save the live canister ID to a command line variable:
```
LIVE_CANISTER_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister --network ic id token )\""
```

4. Check that it worked:
```
echo $LIVE_CANISTER_KEY
```

5. Transfer some tokens to the live canister:
```
dfx canister --network ic call token transfer "($LIVE_CANISTER_KEY, 50_000_000)"
```

6. Get live canister front-end id:
```
dfx canister --network ic id token_assets
```
7. Copy the id from step 6 and add .raw.ic0.app to the end to form a URL.
e.g. zdv65-7qaaa-aaaai-qibdq-cai.raw.ic0.app
